The exocrine pancreas is composed of acinar epithelial cells and ductal epithelium that manufacture the proteolytic enzymes and bicarbonate required for digestion.

These endocrine organs are composed of 99% beta cells and 1% somatostatin-producing delta cells. Compared to the more primitive protochordates (e.g. amphioxus), this represents a stage where all previously scattered insulin-producing cells of the intestinal tissue have now quantitatively migrated to found a new organ involved in sensing blood glucose rather than gut glucose. Only later in evolution, the beta cells are joined by exocrine tissue and alpha cells (exemplified by the rat-, rabbit- and elephant-fishes). Finally, from sharks and onwards in evolution, we have the islet PP-cell entering to complete the pancreas.[well established][VHOG]</property><property name="database_cross_reference">AAO:0010407</property><property name="database_cross_reference">UMLS:C0553695</property><property name="database_cross_reference">SCTID:248202004</property><property name="database_cross_reference">FMA:16017</property><property name="has_exact_synonym">exocrine pancreas</property><property name="database_cross_reference">ZFA:0001249</property><property name="id">UBERON:0000017</property></other_properties></class></classes></data></success>
